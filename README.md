                                                                                   Alive Time

1 Introduction
"Alive Time" is a minimalistic single page app. 

The running app can be found at

<a href="http://iduniven.herokuapp.com">http://iduniven.herokuapp.com</a>

The goal of this app is to provide a simple way to count the days from any given birthday until the current date.

2 Environment
   2.1 Development Environment

   Development tools:

   * Nano Editor
   * Postgres DB
   * Node.js engine

   2.2 Deployment

   Currently the app runs at Heroku cloud platform due to ease of access and good support. Given that a free database was given, the developer did not see the need to use any      extra databases.

3 Reproduction

   This app can be reproduced through any proper node engine, given that all dependencies are met and a proper database is provided.(refer to package.json for more info)            However, there are changes required for sql injections and such. Please be advised that this code is modified for public access. 

  node_module dependencies are removed. Access to database was removed from server.js as well. 

  Please install dependencies and adjust before reproduction.
